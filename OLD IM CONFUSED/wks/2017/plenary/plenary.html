            <h2>Plenary</h2>

            <h3>Resisting 100 Days of Trump</h3>
            <h4>Room 914</h4>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> What does it mean to be a target in the current political climate as a person of color/queer/feminist/youth/Muslim under the Trump presidency? Today, on the 100th Day of Trump, this panel will discuss the ways in which communities have resisted and will continue to resist political oppression. How much is the Trump administration an anomaly to the U.S. political climate, and how much is it not? We must critically reflect on the longer history of how the current political climate came to be and how we can best move forward to work towards a liberated future.
