As a scholar activist and educator, her research stems from a place of revolutionary praxis and love for community. As a first generation Chinese American woman born and raised in New York City her research is intimately tied to Chinese diaspora and the immigrant experience. Her current dissertation research explores how gentrification impacts low-income immigrants and how Chinese residents with limited resources mobilize to fight for their homes, shifting away from the narrative of immigrants as non-political. Outside of graduate school and research, she also works as a community organizer with groups like Asians4BlackLives-NYC, 18 Million and Rising, and CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities. ",Mei Lum,"Mei Lum is the 5th generation owner-in-training of her family's porcelain shop, Wing on Wo & Co (W.O.W) and founder and director of W.O.W's community initiative, The W.O.W Project.

Mei is working hard on building a socially-minded business model for W.O.W that supports the future growth of The W.O.W Project.
