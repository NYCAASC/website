            <h2>Track 2</h2>

            <h3>NYC Take Back Our Education</h3>
            <h4>Room 361</h4>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The election of Betsy DeVos as Sec. Ed serves as a symptom and as evidence of a worsening educational climate for students: the proposals of bills in which publicly funded schools are becoming highly privatized, culturally relevant curriculum and ethnic studies are being attacked, and a continuing policing and militarization of the schools. In this workshop, we will develop a strong analysis of the worsening education crisis of the U.S. with a specific focus on the Filipino youth and student community  and more importantly, how we can address this crisis and fight to #TakeBackOurEducation!</p>

                    <p>Amanda Kat (she/they) is the Deputy Education Officer of Anakbayan-NY. She is a queer filipinx activist, artist, and academic. Currently studying International Relations, Asian Studies, Women's Studies, and English, she aspires to become a civil rights lawyer by day and a Lorena-esque militant by night. She's passionate about fighting for education justice for underserved youth, gender and racial decolonization, and true liberation of the oppressed. Outside of organizing, Amanda writes and publishes poetry, dabbles in visual art, and plays the harp. One day she hopes to create a network of decolonizing resources for the Filipino-American diaspora on the east coast.</p>
