            <h3>Talking across Generations about Japanese American "Internment"</h3>
            <h4>Room 365</h4>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Building from the screening of Brett Kodama's powerful short film One-Two-One-Seven on Japanese Internment, which is now referred to as Japanese Incarceration, this workshop seeks to provide a historical context to what produced the conditions in which these concentration camps were created. In addition, the panelists will discuss the implications of this history to not only their personal experiences, but also the current political climate.</p>
