    <h2>Track 1</h2>

    <h3>Family Acceptance:  API Perspective</h3>
    <h4>Room 361</h4>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Talking to your family members about sexual orientation and gender identity can be challenging within Asian immigrant communities because of generational, cultural and language barriers. What is the best way to start a conversation? Should you even tell them? As Asian immigrant parents of LGBTQ children, we will address some of these fears and examine family expectations and dynamics in a cultural context through personal stories and experiences. Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of where their family members may be coming from and ideas on how to engage them in these conversations.</p>
