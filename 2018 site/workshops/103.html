          <h2>Discovering Our Voices: Storytelling, Literature, and Writing</h2>
          <p class="lead">C 95, 11:45 - 1:10</p>
          <p>Often times, it is difficult to tiptoe the line between exploring our cultural roots and finding our own individuality as Asian Americans through writing. We exist in an in-between of stereotypes and expectations -- an amalgamation of cultural influences from our heritage and upbringing. Mainstream Asian American literature (such as The Joy Luck Club and The Woman Warrior) is often criticized for their authenticity or lack thereof -- does this affect our own writing and how so? This workshop will explore the process of finding our unique selves through writing while still recalling and drawing upon our cultural roots.
