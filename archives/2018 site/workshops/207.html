          <p class="lead">GC 265, 1:45 - 3:10</p>
          <p><em>Note: this workshop will be capped at 30 attendees</em>.</p>
          <p>The journey of self discovery and, ultimately, liberation includes understanding the historical context of a given situation and its influences on a society and individual. But, how might we imagine a future that puts people first -- their whole, unique, beautiful selves? In this light, what does it mean to understand the constructs that are at play and to work collaboratively to envision a future of liberation for all? This is where design-thinking within an equity-centered framework can shed light on pathways that can lead us to a radical future and the possible steps that may take us there. This interactive and introductory workshop will expose participants to the fundamentals of the design-thinking process and how it can be a powerful tool in the difficult, crucial work of making a radical future real.</p>

                  <h3>Esther Kang</h3>
                  <p>Esther Y. Kang is currently an independent human-centered design strategist and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. In this capacity, she partners with teams across sectors and advises leaders at local and state levels to design resident-centered policies and user-friendly services. Esther recently kicked-off the first human-centered design project in Congress with a team of four design researchers as part of a new effort under The OpenGov Foundation. Recent collaborators include What Works Cities' Results for America, Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the W.O.W. Project.

Previously, Esther served a one-year term as the inaugural Designer-in-Residence at the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI) under the Obama administration. As part of her role, she applied human-centered design to several internal projects focusing on organizational and programmatic design and implementation. Esther has also worked in philanthropy, public administration, and arts management creating community-centric programs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. She has served on advisory councils and steering committees of national and regional nonprofit organizations, in addition to being Adjunct Faculty at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA. Esther received her M.A. in social design from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) and her B.F.A. in photography from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). Esther is currently based in Brooklyn, NY, and has spent time in California, Texas, Illinois, and Maryland along with a gap year overseas.</p>
